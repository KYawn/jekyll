## Survey on Security and Privacy of Machine Learning
### 1. Abstract
> ML was used in image processing, natural language processing, pattern recognition, cybersecurity and other fields.

And Scenarios: facial recognition, malware detection, automatic driving, and intrusion detection.
But these algorithms and corresponding training data are vulnerable.

> Academia and industry have found out many security threats against a variety of learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), principle component analysis, clustering, and prevailing deep neural networks.

Survey from two aspects: the training phase and the testing/inferring phase.

defensive techniques, four groups:

* security assessment mechanisms
* countermeasures in the training phase
* countermeasures in the testing or inferring phase
* data security, and privacy

ﬁve notable trends on security threats and defensive techniques of machine learning

1. New security threats towards machine learning are constantly emerging.
2. Security assessment on machine learning based decision systems in adversarial environments becomes a prevailing research area.
3. Data privacy plays an important role in protecting the security of machine learning.
4. Secure deep learning is a new growth point in the ﬁeld of machine learning security.
5. Jointly optimizing security, generalization performance and overhead is required to design secure learning algorithms.

### 2. Introduction
